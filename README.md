This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: the incorrect use of the `CMD` instruction.  The original Dockerfile uses `CMD` incorrectly, which leads to the application not running inside the container. The solution provided shows the correct way to define the command and its arguments using a JSON array. This ensures that the application executes as intended.  This is a simple example, and the problem can become more insidious in more complex Dockerfiles.
